It's difficult to understand YakiBiki's ACL and its "Policy".
Here are some actual ACL practices. When you lost in permissions and policy, see those samples.

Some typical ACLs which are needed in typical Blogs and Wikis are registered in YakiBiki setup(setup.php).
Those typical ACLs may be enough to use for personal user.

* "Publish"

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | Read Only |
| Logined users only | Read Only |

A typical ACL for public pages. Only page owner can edit datas.
This ACL will meet a generic, typical Blog entry.


* "Open Wiki"

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | Read and Edit |
| Logined users only | Read and Edit |

Any one can read and edit this page. This ACL is good when you want for various users to join page editting.
But be careful, it will cause many troubles that non-login users can edit this page.


* "Wiki (editable only for logined users)"

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | Read Only |
| Logined users only | Read and Edit |

This ACL will be default when you want wiki editors from a closed community.
Non-login users can only read, not edit. Login users only can read and edit.

* "Draft" (private mode)

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | non:invisible |

Only page owner can read and edit. You'll use this ACL when writing secret diaries, saving pages as "draft".


* "Public only for Group A"

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | non:invisible |
| Group A | Read Only |

Only members of Group A can read this page. You'll use this ACL when you want sharing little secret document in your groups.


* "Public only for Group A and User X"

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | non:invisible |
| Group A | Read Only |
| User X | Read Only |

Advance version ACL of "Public only for Group A".
...Until here, these ACL doesn't make permission conflict. So, whether "Policy" is positive or negative doesn't matter.


* "Public only for Group A, BUT Hide this page from User Y in Group A"

| Policy | Negative Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | non:invisible |
| Group A | Read Only |
| User Y | non:invisible |

Use "Negative Policy".

Now try to descrive internal process for evaluating ACL permissions in YakiBiki.
First, YakiBiki retrieve users who belongs to groups in ACL, and merges it to users in ACL.
If there're three users "User X", "User Y", User Z" in Group A, result of merge and expanding will be following table.

| User X | Read Only |
| User Y | non:invisible, Read Only |
| User Z | Read Only |

"non:invisible" permission is added only to "User Y".
Here, "Negative Policy" is applied to above table.
Because of "Negative Policy", YakiBiki use "non:invisible" rather than "Read Only".
Then, these users and permissions are evaluated like below :

| User X | Read Only |
| User Y | non:invisible |
| User Z | Read Only |

So, only "User Y" is applied "non:invisible" permission to, though "User Y" belongs to "Group A".
Other users not in Group A and non-login users are applied "non:invisible" by guest and logined user permission to.


* "Public to logined users, Group A can also edit, But Group B can't read"

How pitful Group B...

| Policy | Positive Policy |
| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | Read Only |
| Group A | Read and Edit |
| Group B | non:invisible |

Because of "Positive Policy", YakiBiki applies "Read Only" permission to users who belongs to both Group A and Group B.
Change the policty to "Negative Policy" when you want to apply "non:invisible" permission to all users who belongs to Group B,
