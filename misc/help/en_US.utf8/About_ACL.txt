* What is ACL(Access Control List) in YakiBiki ?

An ACL in YakiBiki is a configuration list of users and groups with permission(hidden/read/read and write).
In YakiBiki, users prepare ACL in advance. When creating new pages, users assign an ACL to a page.

* About "Role" and "Permission"

: Role :
User management role, Group management role, ACL management role, ... e.t.c.
"Role" are flags which decides whether a user can access and operate system management features.
"Role" are individual between each users.
"System role" users only can change own and other user's roles.
: Permission :
Information included in ACL. Permission is related to users or groups.

Following descriptions only focus "Permission".

There're three "Permission" in YakiBiki.
- none:invisible
- Read Only
- Read and Edit

There's no permission which combination is "Editable, but Not Readable". And also, there's no "Delete" permission.
In YakiBiki, only page owner (who created its page) or "System role" user can delete its page datas.
You can "delete" your data by changing acl to "Draft" ACL, its recommended way.

NOTICE: "System role" user can read/edit/delete ALL page datas, ignoreing ACL.

* Configure ACL and Permissions

Users who has "ACL role" or "System role" only can edit ACLs.
Main elements of ACL are following three items.
- Policy
- Permission list for users.
- Permission list for groups.

Above three permissions are available in user/group permission list for each user/groups.
Users or Groups are added explicitly when setting permissions.
Secial user permission (described below) is applied to non-added users/groups.

* Permission Conflict and ACL "Policy"

In YakiBiki ACL, there's probability of permission conflict.
For example, "Read Only" permission to GroupA, "Read and Edit" to GroupB, which permission is applied to users who belongs to both GroupA and GroupB ?

YakiBiki tries to solve these confilict by "Policy" ACL configuration.
There're two policies in YakiBiki.
- Positive Policy
- Negative Policy

"Read and Edit" is the most "Positive" permission. "non:invisible" is the most "Negative" permission.

: Positive Policy :
YakiBiki ALLOWS operations(read or edit) a user want, if one or more permissions which are "Positive" rather than user want are in permission list.
: Negative Policy :
YakiBiki REJECTS operations(read or edit) a user want, if one or more permissions which are "Negative" rather than user want are in permission list.

* Special Users : "Guest (NOT Logined) users", "Logine users"

There're two users in user permission list, "Guest (NOT Logined) users" and "Logine users".
These two special user permissions are applied to implicit users and groups.
For example, YakiBiki applies "Read Only" permissions only to users who don't belongs to any of GroupA, GroupX, GroupY.

| Guest (NOT Logined) users only | non:invisible |
| Logined users only | Read Only |
| GroupA | non:invisible |
| GroupX | non:invisible |
| GroupY | non:invisible |
